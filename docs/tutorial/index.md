# Running mice_microbes remotely on Google Colab
The simplest way to use pyCapsid is using this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luquelab/pyCapsid/blob/main/notebooks/pyCapsid_colab_notebook.ipynb)
which runs mice_microbes on a free Google cloud-based platform in a Jupyter environment. The Colab notebook is self documenting and is designed to be simple to use.
