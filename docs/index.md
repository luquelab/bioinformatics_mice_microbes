# Of Mice and Microbes Group Project Documentation

[mice_microbes](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics_mice_microbes) is a colab script for analyzing nucleotide sequences.


Given a .faa file, it returns sequence properties such as length, GC content, and translated amino acid sequences.

It also performs sequence alignments and produces phylogenetic trees.

Finally, it identifies likely organisms and functions for each sequence using BLAST.
